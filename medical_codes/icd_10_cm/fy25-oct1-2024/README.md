ICD-10-CM codes are an US adaptation of WHO's ICD-10 codes. 
-CM version means Clinical Modification, which is basically 
a list of diagnostic codes for medical conditions.

Sidenote: another adaptation is ICD-10-PCS, which focuses on procedures.
At the moment of creating this file, we don't use ICD-10-PCS codes, but
CPT codes which is another list focusing on procedures, but maintained by 
another organization.
